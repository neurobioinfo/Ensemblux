# Ensemblux pipeline overview
The Ensemblux pipeline was designed to facilitate the application of Ensemblux for demultiplexing real-world pools. We provide two distinct, yet highly comparable pipelines intended for demultiplexing either with or without prior genotype information. Specifically, the pipelines comprises of four distinct steps each :

1. [Selection of Ensemblux pipeline and establishing the working directory (Set up)](Step0.md)
2. [Prepare input files for constituent genetic demultiplexing tools](Step1.md)
3. [Genetic demultiplexing by constituent demultiplexing tools](Step2.md)
4. [Application of the Ensemblux framework](Step3.md)

Each step of the pipeline is comprehensively described in the proceeding sections of the Ensemblux documentation.
