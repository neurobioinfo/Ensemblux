# Ensembleux pipeline 
Ensemblex is an accuracy-weighted ensemble framework for genetic demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA seqeuncing (scRNAseq) data. Ensemblex can be used to demultiplex pools **with** or **without** prior genotype information. It is compatible with Linux workstations. The detail of installing and running this pipeline can be found in tutorial in [ensembleux](https://neurobioinfo.github.io/ensembleux/site/). 

## Contributing
Any contributions or suggestions for improving the Ensemblex pipeline are welcomed and appreciated. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neurobioinfo/ensemblex). Alternatively, you are welcomed to email the developers directly; for any questions please contact Michael Fiorini: michael.fiorini@mail.mcgill.ca
